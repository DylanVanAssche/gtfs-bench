# The GTFS-Madrid-Bench

We present GTFS-Madrid-Bench, **a benchmark to evaluate declarative KG construction engines** that can be used for the provision of access mechanisms to (virtual) knowledge graphs. Our proposal introduces several scenarios that aim at measuring performance and scalability as well as the query capabilities of all this kind of engines, considering their heterogeneity. The datasources used in our benchmark are derived from the [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs) data files of the subway network of Madrid. They can be transformed into several formats (CSV, JSON, SQL and XML) and scaled up. The query set aims at addressing a representative number of SPARQL 1.1 features while covering usual queries that data consumers may be interested in.

David Chaves-Fraga, Freddy Priyatna, Andrea Cimmino, Jhon Toledo, Edna Ruckhaus, & Oscar Corcho (2020). GTFS-Madrid-Bench: A benchmark for virtual knowledge graph access in the transport domain. Journal of Web Semantics, 65. [Online](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2020.100596)


## Requirements for the use:

To have locally installed [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).


## Using Madrid-GTFS-Bench:

1. Run `docker run -itv "$(pwd)":/output oegdataintegration/gtfs-bench`
2. Choose data scales and formats to obtain the distributions you want to tested. Example:

3. Result will be available as `result.zip` in the current working directory


## Resources

Additionally to the generator engine, that provides the data at desirable scales and distributiosn, together with corresponding mappings and queries, there are also common resources openly available to be modify or use by any practicioner or developer:

- Folder [mappings](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench/tree/master/mappings) contains RML mappings for CSV, XML, JSON and RDB distributions of the input GTFS dataset, R2RML mapping for RDB and xR2RML mapping for MongoDB. It also includes CSVW annotation for the CSV distributions.
- Folder [queries](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench/tree/master/queries) includes 18 queries with different levels of complexity including a representative set of SPARQL 1.1. operators. Additionally, the folder contains [11 simple queries](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench/tree/master/queries/simple) that will help to test the basic capabilities of virutal KG construction engines (i.e., to understand if the engine is able to translate correctly the SPARQL operators over different GTFS distributions before starting to test performance and scalability).

## Desirable Metrics:

We highly recommend that (virutalizers or materializers) KG construction engines tested with this benchmark provide (at least) the following metris:
- Total execution time
- Number of answers	
- Initial delay	
- Dief@k (only for continuous/streaming behavior)*	
- Dief@t (only for continuous/streaming behavior)*

For virtual knowledge graphs systems, we also encourage developers and tester to provide:
- Loading time	
- Mapping translation time (if applies)
- Number of requests
- Source selection time	
- Query generation (or disitribution) time
- Query rewritting time
- Query translation time
- Query exececution time
- Results aggregation time
